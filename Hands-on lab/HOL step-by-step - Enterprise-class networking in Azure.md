# Enterprise-class networking in Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will setup and configure virtual networks with subnets in Azure. You will also learn how to secure virtual networks by implementing Azure Firewall, service endpoints, network security groups and application security groups, as well as configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network via a jump box and provision a site-to-site VPN connection from another virtual network, providing emulation of hybrid connectivity from an on-premises environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components. 


## Overview

You have been asked by Woodgrove Financial Services to provision a proof of concept deployment that will be used by the Woodgrove team to gain familiarity with a complex Virtual Networking deployment, including all of the components that enable the solution. Specifically, the Woodgrove team will be learning about:

-   How to bypass system routing to accomplish custom routing scenarios.

-   How to capitalize on load balancers to distribute load and ensure service availability.

-   How to implement Azure Firewall to control hybrid and cross-virtual network traffic flow based on policies.

-   How to implement a combination of Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) to control traffic flow within virtual networks.

-   How to leverage service endpoints to provide restricted access to Azure PaaS services.

The result of this proof of concept will be an environment resembling this diagram:

## Solution architecture

    -  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG1**.

    -  Location: **(US) South Central US**

    -  Virtual network gateway route propagation: **Disabled**

1.  When the dialog looks like the following screenshot, select **Create**.
    
    ![This represents completed fields when initially creating a route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image36.png "Create route table")

1.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create the **AppRT** route table:

    -  Name: **AppRT**

    -  Subscription: Choose your subscription.

    -  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, select the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG2**.

    -  Location: **(US) South Central US**

    -  Virtual network gateway route propagation: **Disabled**

1.  Once route tables are created, your **Route tables** blade should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Route Table listing.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image38.png "Route table link")

### Task 2: Add routes to each route table

1.  Select on the **AppRT** route table, and choose **Routes**.

    ![On the Route table blade, under Settings, Routes is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image39.png "Route table blade ")

1.  On the **Routes** blade, choose +**Add**. Enter the following information, and select **OK**:

    -  Route name: **AppToInternet**

    -  Address prefix: **0.0.0.0/0**

    ![The AppToInternet route is being added.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image40.png "Add route configuration")

1.  Repeat this procedure to add the **DataToMgmt** route using the following information:

    -  Route name: **AppToMgmt**

    -  Address prefix: **10.7.0.8/29**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4**

    ![The AppToMgmt route is being added.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image41.png "Edit route")

1.  Upon completion, your routes in the **DataRT** route table should look like the following screenshot:

    ![AppRT route table is seen here if successful.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image43.png "Route table ")

1.  In the Azure Portal, go to All Services and type Route in the search box and select **Route tables**

1.  Select **MgmtRT**, and choose **Routes**.

    ![Under Name, MgmtRT is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image50.png "MgmtRT")

1.  On the **Routes** blade, choose +**Add**. Enter the following information, and choose **OK**:

    -  Route name: **MgmtToOnPremises**

    -  Address prefix: **192.168.0.0/16**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual network gateway**

    -  Next hop address: **Leave it blank**.

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image51.png "Add route")

1.  Add the **MgmtToApp** route using the following information:

    -  Route name: **MgmtToApp**

    -  Address prefix: **10.7.1.128/25**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4** (this is the private IP of Azure Firewall)

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image52.png "Add route")

1.  Upon completion, your routes in the **MgmtRT** route table should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Continuation of steps to adding another route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image54.png "Route table")

    >**Note:** The route tables and routes you have just created are not associated with any subnets yet, so they are not impacting any traffic flow yet. This will be accomplished later in the lab.

## Exercise 4: Deploy n-tier application and validate functionality

Duration: 90 minutes

In this task, you will provision the CloudShop application using an ARM template deployment. This application has a web tier and a data tier.

## Exercise 11: Validate connectivity from 'on-premises' to Azure

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will validate connectivity from your simulated on-premises environment to Azure.

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to validate connectivity

1.  Create a new virtual machine in the OnPremVnet virtual network. In the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource** . In the **Search the Marketplace**, type **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**, in the list of results, select **Windows Server**, in the expanded list of images, select **[smalldisk] Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**, and then select **Create**.

1.  On the **Create a virtual machine** blade, on the **Basics** tab, enter the following information, and select **Next : Disks >**:

    -  Subscription: Choose your subscription.

    -  Resource group: Choose **Create new** and enter **OnPremVMRG**.
      
    -  Virtual machine name: **OnPremVM**

    -  Region: **(US) East US** (this must much the region you created the OnPremVNet virtual network)

    -  Availability options: **No infrastructure redundancy required**

    -  Image: **[smalldisk] Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**

    -  Size: **Standard DS1 v2**

    -  User name: **demouser**

    -  Password: **demo\@pass123**

    -  Enable auto-shutdown: **Off**

1.  On the **Create a virtual machine** blade, on the **Review + Create** tab, ensure the validation passes, and choose **Create**. The virtual machine will take about 5 minutes to provision.

### Task 2: Configure routing for simulated 'on-premises' to Azure traffic

When packets arrive from the simulated 'on-premises' Virtual Network (OnPremVNet) to the 'Azure-side' (WGVNet1), they arrive at the gateway WGVNet1Gateway. This gateway is in a gateway subnet (10.7.0.0/29). For packets to be directed to the Azure firewall, we need another route table and route to be associated with the gateway subnet on the 'Azure-side'.

1.  On the Azure portal, in the hub menu, choose **All services** at the bottom. Enter **Route** in the search box, and select **Route tables**.

1.  On the **Route tables** blade, select **Add**.

1.  On the **Route table** blade, enter the following information:

    -  Name: **WGAzureVNetGWRT**

    -  Subscription: Choose your subscription.

    -  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG1**.

    -  Location: **(US) South Central US** (this must match the location in which you created the **WGVNet1** virtual network)

    -  Virtual network gateway route propagation: **Disabled**

    ![Creating the WGAzureVNetGWRT route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image143.png "Create route table")

1.  Choose **Create**.

1.  Choose **WGAzureVNetGWRT** route table.

    ![Selecting the WGAzureVNetGWRT route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image144.png "Route tables")

1.  Select **Routes**.

1.  On the **Routes** blade, select the **+Add** button. Enter the following information, and choose **OK**:

    -  Route name: **OnPremToAppSubnet**

    -  Address prefix: **10.7.1.128/25**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4**

    ![Routes blade: information entry](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image145.png "Add route")

1.  On the **WGAzureVNetGWRT - Routes** blade, select **Subnets**.

1.  On the **Subnets** blade, select **Associate**.

1.  On the **Associate subnet** blade, select **Virtual Network**. Then, choose on **WGVNet1**.

    ![WGVNet1 Selection](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image148.png "Associate subnet")

1.  The **Choose subnet** blade opens. Select **Gateway Subnet**. Then, choose **OK** to complete the association.

    ![Opening of the Choose subnet blade - Selecting ok to complete the association.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image149.png "Choose subnet")

    >**Note:** At this point, you have configured your enterprise network. You should be able to test your Enterprise Class Network from one region to another. Your testing can include the following scenarios:

    -  On your lab VM, open Internet Explorer and browse to the web application deployed to the WGVnet2 via the public IP address of the Azure Firewall (20.45.4.50). Note that this IP address can be also be reached by any of the Azure virtual machines provisioned in this lab.

    -  On the 'on-premises' virtual machine (OnPremVM), attempt to initiate a Remote Desktop session to any virtual machine on the AppSubnet (10.7.1.128/25). Note that this should fail since it is blocked by Azure Firewall.

    -  On the 'on-premises' virtual machine (OnPremVM), open Internet Explorer and browse to the web application deployed to the WGVnet2 via the private IP address of the Azure Load Balancer (10.7.1.254). Note that this traffic is routed (and allowed) via Azure Firewall.

    -  On the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1), open Internet Explorer and browse to the web application deployed to the WGVnet2 via the private IP address of the Azure Load Balancer(10.7.1.254). Note that this traffic is not routed via Azure Firewall.

    -  On the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1), initiate a Remote Desktop session to the WGWEB1 via its private IP address (10.7.1.132). This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall. However, an attempt to connect via Remote Desktop to the WGSQL1 via its private IP address shoudl fail since it is blocked by a network security group.

    -  On the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1), initiate a Remote Desktop session to the WGWEB2 via its private IP address (10.7.1.133). This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall. However, an attempt to connect via Remote Desktop to the WGSQL1 via its private IP address shoudl fail since it is blocked by a network security group.

    -  On the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1), initiate a Remote Desktop session to the WGSQL1 via its private IP address (10.7.1.134). This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall.

    -  Create a file share in the storage account created in exercise 10 and map a drive to it from both the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1) and one of the virtual machines on the WGVNet2 virtual network (WGWEB1, WGWEB2, or WGSQL1). This should be successful since it is allowed by Service Endpoints. Next, attempt mapping a drive from the 'on-premises' virtual machine (OnPremVM). This should fail since the direct route associated with Service Endpoint does not apply to this virtual machine. 

    >**Note:** You will need to create the file share from the jump host virtual machine (WGMGMT1), not from your lab virtual machine due to the Azure Storage firewall settings you configured in exercise 10.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

After you have successfully completed the Enterprise-class networking in Azure hands-on lab step-by-step, you will want to delete the Resource Groups. This will free up your subscription from future charges.
