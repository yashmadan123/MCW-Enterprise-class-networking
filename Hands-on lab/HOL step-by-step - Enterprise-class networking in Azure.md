# Enterprise-class networking in Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will setup and configure a virtual network with subnets in Azure. You will also learn how to secure the virtual network by deploying a network virtual appliances and configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network with a jump box and a site-to-site VPN connection.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components. 


## Overview

You have been asked by Woodgrove Financial Services to provision a proof of concept deployment that will be used by the Woodgrove team to gain familiarity with a complex Virtual Networking deployment, including all of the components that enable the solution. Specifically, the Woodgrove team will be learning about:

-   How to bypass system routing to accomplish custom routing scenarios

-   How to capitalize on load balancers to distribute load and ensure service availability

-   How to implement a partner firewall solution to control traffic flow based on policies

The result of this proof of concept will be an environment resembling this diagram:

## Solution architecture

![This image represents an entire overview of an environment for the result of this proof of concept.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

## Requirements

You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Exercise 3: Create route tables with required routes

Duration: 15 minutes

Route Tables are containers for User Defined Routes (UDRs). The route table is created and associated with a subnet. UDRs allow you to direct traffic in ways other than normal system routes would. In this case, UDRs will direct traffic from 'internal' subnets to the firewall appliance.

### Task 1: Create route tables

1.  On the main portal menu, select **More services** located at the bottom of the menu. Type **route** into the search box, and choose **Route tables**.

    ![In the pane of the Azure portal, More services is selected. Route is typed in the search box, and Route tables is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image34.png "Azure Portal")

2.  On the **Route tables** blade, select **Add**

    ![The Add button is selected on the Route tables blade top menu bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image35.png "Route tables blade")

3.  On the **Route table** blade enter the following information:

    a.  Name: **MgmtRT**

    b.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**

    c.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG1**

    d.  Location: **South Central**

    When the dialog looks like the following screenshot, select Create.
    ![This represents completed fields when initially creating a route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image36.jpeg "Create route table")

4.  After a few seconds, if the new route table does not show in the portal, select **Refresh**

    ![The Refresh button is selected on the Route tables blade top menu bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image37.png "Route tables blade ")

5.  After you see the route table you created, complete steps 2 and 3 again to create the **DataRT** route table:

    e.  Name: **DataRT**

    f.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**

    g.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, select the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG2**

    h.  Location: **south central**

6.  After you see the **DataRT** route table created (you may need to select **Refresh** again), complete steps 2 and 3 again to create the **WebRT** route table:

    i.  Name: **WebRT**

    j.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**

    k.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG2**

    l.  Location: south central

7.  Once route tables are created, your **Route tables** blade should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Route Table listing.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image38.jpeg "Route table link")

### Task 2: Add routes to each route table

1.  Select on the **DataRT** route table, and choose **Routes**

    ![On the Route table blade, under Settings, Routes is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image39.png "Route table blade ")

### Task 2: Configure routing for simulated 'on-premises' to Azure traffic

When packets arrive from the simulated 'on-premises' Virtual Network (OnPremVNet) to the 'Azure-side' (WGVNET1), they arrive at the gateway WGVNETGWVNET1. This gateway is in a gateway subnet (10.7.0.0/29). For packets to be directed to the barracuda firewall, we need another route table and route to be associated with the gateway subnet on the 'Azure' side.

1.  On the main portal menu, choose **More services** at the bottom. Enter **route** in the search box, and select **Route tables**.

    ![In the Azure Portal, More services is selected. The search field is set to route, and in the results section, Route tables is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image34.png "Azure Portal")
